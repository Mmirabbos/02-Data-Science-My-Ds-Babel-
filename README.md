# My Ds Babel

## Task
The task is to convert a file from cvs format to db (sql) and vice versa.
You need to write two functions that convert them from one to another format

In this example I am using two files.

[list of all volcanos](https://storage.googleapis.com/qwasar-public/track-ds/list_volcano.csv)

[list of all fault lines](https://storage.googleapis.com/qwasar-public/track-ds/all_fault_line.db)

## Description

This code converts 2 formats namely csv and sql.
I used two functions for ease of use `def sql_to_csv()` and `def sql_to_csv():`

## Installation
You can use this code in a variety of situations where you want to convert a file from one form to another without necessarily changing the file name.

I use libraries
```
pip3 install pandas
pip3 install db-sqlite3
```

## Library Info

I use `pandas` because it is very convenient for reading and translating between formats

I'm using `sqlite3` for file communication

## Usage
You simply enter your file and convert by choosing a function for your file
